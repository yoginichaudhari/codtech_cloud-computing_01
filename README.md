## Task Explanation (No Card Access)

Since I do not currently have access to a credit or debit card, I was unable to activate real cloud storage services such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, which require billing information even for free-tier accounts.

Instead, I have simulated the behavior of cloud storage using a local directory in Python (`my_bucket`) within a Replit environment. This includes:
- Creating a bucket-like folder structure  
- Listing files in the bucket  
- Reading file contents from the simulated cloud bucket

If deployed on a real cloud platform, the same logic could be adapted using cloud SDKs like `boto3` (for AWS) or `google-cloud-storage` (for GCP).

This simulation demonstrates a clear understanding of how cloud storage works and fulfills the functional requirements of the task.
